Project Name: Only Celebs
  

Business Context:
The rise of social media has given celebrities a direct channel to connect with their fans, but existing platforms like Instagram, Twitter (X), and TikTok are designed for the general public. This creates challenges for celebrities, their management teams, and their audiences: overcrowded feeds, fake accounts, lack of exclusivity, and difficulty in managing brand image within an environment not tailored to high-profile figures.

OnlyCelebs seeks to address this gap by providing a exclusive platform where celebrities can share content, interact with their fanbase, and collaborate with other public figures in a secure environment. By focusing solely on verified celebrities, the app ensures authenticity, eliminates impersonation risks, and creates a trusted space for both creators and fans.
  

Problem Statment:
While mainstream social media platforms have become essential tools for celebrities to reach their audiences, they were not designed with the unique needs of high-profile users in mind. Current platforms present several challenges:

Impersonation and Fake Accounts: Fans are frequently misled by unverified profiles, making it difficult for celebrities to maintain real connections.

Overcrowded Environments: Celebrities compete for visibility in feeds filled with non-celebrity content.

Limited Control: Traditional platforms prioritize algorithms and advertising.

Security and Privacy Risks: High-profile accounts are frequent targets for hacking, harassment, and unwanted exposure. 

Scope:
This solution will be available on a desktop and mobile devices. The app will work on apple and andriod operating systems. 

Out of Scope:
  We will not try to import any data from other apps or sources. We will not try to make a usable store simular to a app like TicTok.

Assumptions:
It is assumed that our solution will only be a software product. Users must have a stable internet connection to use features. Users will register with a email or phone number. A majority of content will be user generated content.
  

**Features:**
The user is able to post videos, pictures, music, and text. Each post can be liked/disliked and get comments from other users.
Users get points based on how many likes or dislikes their posts get. (1 like = 1 point, 1 dislike = -1 point). With these points they will be able to buy accessories, tools, items, and etc. There will also be a leaderboard showing people with the most points out of everyone.
**Log in:**
Basic login screen that containts a place to enter your username and passowrd. There will be an option to create an account. The screen will lock once someone has entered in information incorrectly 3 times in a row.
**Main Banner:**
The banner will have the company logo. It will also contain a waffle on the side that will lead to a drop down menu.
**Main Page:**
Constantly refreshes new posts from people that you follow. Just above the posts stories from the people you follow will appear. Something similar to Instagram.
