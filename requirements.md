The user is able to post videos, pictures, music, and text. Each post can be liked/disliked and get comments from other users.
Users get points based on how many likes or dislikes their posts get. (1 like = 1 point, 1 dislike = -1 point). With these points they will be able to buy accessories, tools, items, and etc. There will also be a leaderboard showing people with the most points out of everyone.
**Log in:**
Basic login screen that containts a place to enter your username and passowrd. There will be an option to create an account. The screen will lock once someone has entered in information incorrectly 3 times in a row.
